The dataset includes 7110 images.
Fire-smoke are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 50 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 15 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -12 and +12 degrees
* Random shear of between -3° to +3° horizontally and -3° to +3° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -12 and +12 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1 percent of pixels
